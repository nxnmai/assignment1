        <dt>Nguyen Xuan Nang Mai:</dt>
            <dd>I am a freshman at Swinburne University in Ho Chi Minh City, currently pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence. With a strong passion for AI, math, and logical problem-solving, I am dedicated to developing my programming skills, particularly in languages like Ruby and Python. My interests extend beyond academics to sports and fitness, which help me maintain a balanced lifestyle. I am currently working on improving my analytical and problem-solving skills to excel as an AI engineer and aim to secure a part-time job in IT, preferably in AI or machine learning. My learning approach involves self-study, online resources, and AI tools, as I navigate the challenges of time management with university coursework and personal responsibilities.</dd>
        <dt>Le Quang Dinh</dt>
            <dd>I am a first year student at Swinburne University in Ho Chi Minh City, and my major is Data Science. Iâ€™m currently working on defining myself and improving thinking skills to look for better approaches in studying unique perspectives and in life.</dd>
        <dt>Bui Minh Duc</dt>
            <dd>As a freshman in the IoT program at Swinburne, I'm thrilled to be part of such a dynamic and forward-thinking community.  I've always been fascinated by how technology can connect us and improve our lives, and I'm eager to learn the skills needed to bring my own ideas to life.</dd>
