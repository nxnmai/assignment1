	<h1>Enhancements</h1>
	<!-- enhancements made on page jobs.html -->
	<h2>:hover element on page jobs.html</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This is the <a href="jobs.html#to-apply">hyperlink</a> to where we applied the hover effect for the button, please click to redirect and see the effects on the button.</li>
		<li>The button was implemented with animation when our cursor hovers through. When hover, the button will change the text colour from black to white and also the background colour from white to orange.</li>
		<li>Instead of just a static button, an interactive hover effect is added. The colour transition improves visual feedback, making the website more dynamic and engaging. Also, users will get a clear indication that the button is interactive, which improves usability.</li>
		<li>The effect is achieved using CSS :hover with smooth transitions:</li>
	</ul>
	<pre>
		<code>
			#to-apply {
				background-color: white; 
				border: 2px solid #ff5b0f;
				color: black;
				padding: 16px 32px;
				text-align: center;
				text-decoration: none;
				display: inline-block;
				font-size: 16px;
				margin: 4px 2px;
				cursor: pointer;
				transition-duration: 0.5s;
			}
				
			#to-apply:hover {
				background-color: #ff5b0f;
				color: white;
			}
		</code>
	</pre>
	<ul>
		<li>References: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php">hover</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp">transitions</a>.</li>
		<li>It extends beyond basic HTML and CSS from lectures and tutorials:</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li>Smooth transition effect: the <strong>transition-duration: 0.5s;</strong> ensures a gradual and visually appealing color change instead of an instant switch.</li>
				<li>Border styling: the <strong>orange border #ff5b0f</strong> helps the button stand out.</li>
				<li>Better UX with cursor feedback: The <strong>cursor: pointer;</strong> makes it clear that the button is clickable.</li>
				<li>Custom padding and size: instead of default button styles, the button is designed with <strong>padding: 16px 32px;</strong> for better visibility and accessbility.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>How it supports interactivity and improves UX:</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li>Smooth user experience: The transition effect creates a polished, modern feel.</li>
				<li>Navigation enhancement: the hyperlink allows users to jump directly to the application page, making navigation more efficient and link the pages together.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- enhancements made on page apply.html -->
	<h2>:hover elements on page apply.html</h2>
	<p>Enhancement: about :hover animations</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Support user to navigate better in the form</li>
		<li>The code needed to implement the feature is :hover. eg: .grilledoctopus-form-radio-container label span:hover </li>
		<li>Moreover, I used flexbox layout for better aligning stuff, div and span for better manipulating content in CSS</li>
		<li>In short, it improves user experience in the website</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This is the hyperlinks: <a href="apply.html#male">gender</a> <a href="apply.html#FTD23_skill1">skills list</a> <a href="apply.html#submit_button">skills list</a> to where we applied the hover effect for the button, please click to redirect and see the effects on the button.</p>

	<!-- enhancements made on page index.html and about.html -->
	<h2>:hover elements on page index.html and about.html</h2> 
	<ul>
		<li>These are the <a href="index.html#banner">hyperlink</a> and the <a href="about.html#banner">hyperlink</a> to where we applied the hover effect for the button, please click to redirect and see the effects on the button.</li>
		<li>The logo was implemented with animation when our cursor hovers through. When hover, the the cursor will change to the pointer.</li>
		<li>When you hover over the elements, they will change their color from orange to white and they will appear a horizontal line slowly from left to right under the elements</li>
	</ul>

	<!-- enhancements made for implementing responsive design -->
	<h2>Implement Responsive Design (media query)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Instead of using a single fixed design, the website adapts to different screen sizes, improving user experience by making navigation, readability, and interactions more seamless.</li>
		<li>An additional CSS file ensures that the layout, font sizes, button styles, etc. adjust dynamically for <strong>mobile phones and tablets</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
